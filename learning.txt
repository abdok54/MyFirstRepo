What I have learned from this course is the importance of diversification in building a strong investment portfolio. By spreading investments across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cash, I can reduce overall risk and create more stable long-term returns. This strategy helps protect against market volatility and aligns well with different financial goals and risk levels.
